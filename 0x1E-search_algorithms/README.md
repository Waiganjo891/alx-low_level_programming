	Task 0:		0-linear.c
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the first index where value is located
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

	Task1:		1-binary.c
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

	Task2:		2-O
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?

	Task3:		3-O
What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?

	Task4:		4-O
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

	Task5:		5-O
What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

	Task6:		6-O
What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?

	Task7:		100-jump.c
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm
